  Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it's

  at the same time - your messages sync seamlessly across any number of
  your phones, tablets or computers.

  With Telegram, you can send messages, photos, videos and files of any
  type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as create groups for up to 5000
  people or channels for broadcasting to unlimited audiences. You can
  write to your phone contacts and find people by their usernames. As a
  result, Telegram is like SMS and email combined - and can take care
  of all your personal or business messaging needs.
